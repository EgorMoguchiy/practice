Write a script which takes n arguments:
1. If n is equal 0, then script will finish with error
2. If n -gt 0 then it checks if each passed argument represents a name of a directory
3. If it's true and if the directory can be read, script list and shows all text (txt) files and it sums all numbers from the files
4. Files can contain numbers and words separated by space(white char). Words and other symbols must be ignored
5. Also script must find max value in all files from directories passed as arguments 
6. All information should be printed on the standard output, all errors must be sent to standard diagnostic output
